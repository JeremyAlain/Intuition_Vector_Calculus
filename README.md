# Intuition_Vector_Calculus
This repository contains a summary about the most important topics in Vector Calculus. The main goal is to train your intuition of the concepts. 
Unfortunately I did not fully complete it and the following topics are missing: 
  - Green's Theorem
  - Stoke's Theorem
  - Gauss Theorem
  
  It includes the following topics: 

1 Flux 
2 Divergence 
3 Line Integral of scalar-valued functions 
4 Introduction to a line integral of a vector field 
5 Line integrals as circulation (Macroscopic) 
6 The curl (Microscopic) 1
6.1 Components of the curl(another approach) 
7 Gradient Theorem (Fundamental Theorem for line integrals)
